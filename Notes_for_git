git show HEAD~2 mars.txt shows what changes we made "at" an older commit as well as commit message, rather than the "differences" between a commit and our working directory
HEAD records the last saved commit

git checkout -f master mars.txt: restore to the last commit
-f :force

It's possible to ignore a subfolder only, eg add results/plots/ to .gitignore

*.data #ignore all data files
!final.data # except final.data

origin: Git uses this name be default when we clone a repository.

If you want to save changes made by checkout, add and commit it.
